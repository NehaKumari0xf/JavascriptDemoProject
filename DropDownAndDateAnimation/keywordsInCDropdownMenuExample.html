        ['01','auto','This is the default storage class for all the variables declared inside a function or a block. Hence, the keyword auto is rarely used while writing programs in C language. Auto variables can be only accessed within the block/function they have been declared and not outside them (which defines their scope). Of course, these can be accessed within nested blocks within the parent block/function in which the auto variable was declared. However, they can be accessed outside their scope as well using the concept of pointers given here by pointing to the very exact memory location where the variables reside. They are assigned a garbage value by default whenever they are declared.'],
        ['02','break','Unconditional control statement used to terminate switch and looping statements.'],
        ['03','case','Used to repersent a case (option) in switch statement.'],
        ['04','char','Used to represent charachter data type.'],
        ['05','const','Used to define a constant.'],
        ['06','continue','Uunconditional control statement used to pass the contrel to the begining of looping statements.'],
        ['07','default','Used to represent a default case (option) in switch statement.'],
        ['08','do','Used to define do block in do-while statement.'],
        ['09','double','Used to represent double datatype.'],
        ['10','else','Used to define <b>FALSE</b> block of if statement.'],
        ['11','enum','Used to define enumarated datatypes'],
        ['12','extern','Used to represent external storage class. Extern storage class simply tells us that the variable is defined elsewhere and not within the same block where it is used. Basically, the value is assigned to it in a different block and this can be overwritten/changed in a different block as well. So an extern variable is nothing but a global variable initialized with a legal value where it is declared in order to be used elsewhere. It can be accessed within any function/block. Also, a normal global variable can be made extern as well by placing the ‘extern’ keyword before its declaration/definition in any function/block. This basically signifies that we are not initializing a new variable but instead we are using/accessing the global variable only. The main purpose of using extern variables is that they can be accessed between two different files which are part of a large program. For more information on how extern variables work, have a look at this link. '],
        ['13','float','Used to represent floating point datatype.'],
        ['14','for','Used to define a looping statement. '],
        ['15','goto','Used to represent unconditional control statement.'],
        ['16','if','Used to define a conditional control statement.'],
        ['17','int','Used to represent integer datatype.'],
        ['18','long','It is a type modifier that alters the basic datatype.'],
        ['19','register','Used to repersent register storage class. This storage class declares register variables that have the same functionality as that of the auto variables. The only difference is that the compiler tries to store these variables in the register of the microprocessor if a free registration is available. This makes the use of register variables to be much faster than that of the variables stored in the memory during the runtime of the program. If a free registration is not available, these are then stored in the memory only. Usually few variables which are to be accessed very frequently in a program are declared with the register keyword which improves the running time of the program. An important and interesting point to be noted here is that we cannot obtain the address of a register variable using pointers.'],
        ['20','return','Used to terminate a function execution'],
        ['21','short','It is a type modifier that alters the basic datatype.'],
        ['22','signed','It is a type modifier that alters the basic datatype.'],
        ['23','sizeof','It is an operator that gives size of the memory of a variable.'],
        ['24','static','Used to create static variables - constants. This storage class is used to declare static variables which are popularly used while writing programs in C language. Static variables have the property of preserving their value even after they are out of their scope! Hence, static variables preserve the value of their last use in their scope. So we can say that they are initialized only once and exist till the termination of the program. Thus, no new memory is allocated because they are not re-declared. Their scope is local to the function to which they were defined. Global static variables can be accessed anywhere in the program. By default, they are assigned the value 0 by the compiler. '],
        ['25','struct','Used to create structures - Userdefined datatypes.'],
        ['26','switch','Used to define switch - case statement.'],
        ['27','typedef','Used to specify temporary name for the datatypes.'],
        ['28','union','Used to create union for grouping diffrent types under a name.'],
        ['29','unsigned','It is a type modifer that alters the basic datatype.'],
        ['30','void','Used to indicate nothing -  return value, parameter of a function.'],
        ['31','volatile','Used to creating volatile objects.'],
